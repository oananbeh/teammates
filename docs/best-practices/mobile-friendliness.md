# Mobile-Friendliness Best Practices

TEAMMATES aims to be easy to use on mobile devices on top of desktop devices. Mobile-friendliness can be subjective, but we have compiled some general guidelines below.

Note that the smallest screen width TEAMMATES supports is 360px.

## Content

* Content should be responsive to different screen sizes (e.g. mobile, tablet, desktop).
* Content should not overflow on smaller screen sizes.
* Horizontal scrolling should be reduced as much as possible.
* Content should be clearly readable on smaller screen sizes.

## Interactive elements (e.g. buttons, links, tooltips)

* Interactive elements should be spaced far apart enough that users can easily tap them on mobile devices.
* Tooltips that appear on hover should also be accessible on mobile devices (e.g. tap and hold).
