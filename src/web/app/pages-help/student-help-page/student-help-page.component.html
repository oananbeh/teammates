  Getting Started
</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Join the course</b> by clicking the link given in the email you received from TEAMMATES.<br>
    Note that you need to join a course only once per course.<br>
    Also note that joining a course is optional. If you do not join, you can still submit feedback and view feedback
    responses using links sent to you by TEAMMATES. If you join, you get access to extra features such as the ability
    to see all your feedback sessions in a single home page.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Do the pending submissions</b> (if any).<br>
    You will need to <b>use the "Submit Feedback" button</b> in order to submit your responses
    (including any intermediate/draft responses) as the system will not perform any kind of auto-save.
  </li>
  <li>You can <b>edit your submissions</b> up to the closing time of the respective session.</li>
  <li>You can <b>view session results</b> after the instructor has published session results. The system will notify
    you via email when results are available for viewing.
  </li>
</ol>

  Frequently Asked Questions
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>What should I do if I cannot see any/some of my courses I should be able to see in the system?</b>
    <div>
      These are the possible reasons:
      <ol>
        <li>
          You used a different Google account to access TEAMMATES in the past.
          In that case, you need to use the same Google account to access TEAMMATES again.
          Log out and re-log in using the other Google account.
        </li>
        <li>
          You changed the primary email from a non-Gmail address to a Gmail address recently.
          In that case, email <a href="mailto:{{ supportEmail }}">{{ supportEmail }}</a> so that we can
          reconfigure your account to use the new Gmail address.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>What should I do if I'm unable to submit my response?</b>
    <div>
      <a href="mailto:{{ supportEmail }}">Email us</a> so that we can assist you with your submission.
      Note that we cannot do much if the submission deadline is over. It is not up to us (the TEAMMATES team) to
      accept overdue submissions.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>What should I do if I didn't receive the link to submit responses or view results?</b>
    <div>
      These are some solutions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Check your spam/junk email folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to <a tmRouterLink="/web/front/help/session-links-recovery">the session links recovery page</a> and request TEAMMATES to resend the link.
          You should specify the exact email address that was used by your instructor to enroll you in the course.
          Usually, this should be your school email address. You can ask your instructor if you're unsure.
        </li>
        <li>
          If none of the options above works, <a href="mailto:{{ supportEmail }}">email us</a> and we will resend the email using an alternate means.
          For identification purpose, you should use the email address that was used to enroll you in the course.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>What should I do if my team or my name is not displayed correctly?</b>
    <div>
      Your team and your name are set by your course instructor and you should contact the instructor to change accordingly.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Why can't I see the feedback I receive after submitting my responses?</b>
    <div>
      You will only be able to see the feedback received after your instructor publishes the session results.
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
